        <h2>The MODCT Website!</h2>
        <h3>By James Michelson</h3>
        <p>After a long while I have finally finished the first version of the website. What do you think? I have
          forgone
          some features but will add them in later. Shoot me an email at james@makeourdreamscometrue.com for any
          suggestions to the site. Roachplus is on it's way, so keep an eye out for that, I just got a lot more storage
          in
          the home server and will put that up and running as soon as I can get to it.</p>

        <h2>Charity Never Faileth</h2>
        <h3>By President Thomas S. Monson</h3>
        <p>I have in mind the charity that impels us to be sympathetic, compassionate, and merciful, not only in times
          of sickness and affliction and distress but also in times of weakness or error on the part of others.

          There is a serious need for the charity that gives attention to those who are unnoticed, hope to those who
          are
          discouraged, aid to those who are afflicted. True charity is love in action. The need for charity is
          everywhere.

          Needed is the charity which refuses to find satisfaction in hearing or in repeating the reports of
          misfortunes
          that come to others, unless by so doing, the unfortunate one may be benefited. The American educator and
          politician Horace Mann once said, “To pity distress is but human; to relieve it is godlike” [Horace Mann,
          Lectures on Education (1845), 297].

          Charity is having patience with someone who has let us down. It is resisting the impulse to become offended
          easily. It is accepting weaknesses and shortcomings. It is accepting people as they truly are. It is looking
          beyond physical appearances to attributes that will not dim through time. It is resisting the impulse to
          categorize others. (“Charity Never Faileth,” Ensign or Liahona, Nov. 2010, 124)

        <h2>Annie</h2>
        <h3>By Adam Michelson</h3>
        <p>It's a musical set in the 1930s playing at the Beale Street Theater December 11th-13th and 18th-20th. I have
          three roles in it, Drake (Oliver Warbucks' butler), Bert Healy (radio show host) and Cordell Hull (President's
          cabinet). Come and see!</p>
